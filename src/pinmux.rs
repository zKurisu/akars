//! SG2002 pin-mux configuration via the kernel's `/dev/pinmux` device.
//!
//! On this board the non-console UARTs (UART1/2/3) are enabled in the device
//! tree but have **no** pinctrl, so their TX/RX pads default to another
//! function and the port is electrically silent even though `/dev/ttySN`
//! opens fine. The kernel exposes `/dev/pinmux`, which writes the SoC FMUX
//! registers (base `0x0300_1000`) from user space. Its text interface takes
//! one `"0xOFFSET VALUE"` line per pad; offsets are relative to the FMUX base.
//!
//! UART1 is muxed onto the JTAG pads (function select = 4):
//!   - `JTAG_CPU_TMS` @ FMUX 0x64 -> UART1_TX
//!   - `JTAG_CPU_TCK` @ FMUX 0x68 -> UART1_RX
//! Configuring this consumes the JTAG pins (debug JTAG becomes unavailable).
